            <div class="center1"><h2>2011 St. Louis Cardinals, Best Year of My Life</div></h2>
            <p>In baseball, there are 162 games that make up a season. Not very often does it take all 162 to determine if your gonna make the playoffs but this year was one of them. Chris Carpenter pitched a complete game shutout and the Cardinals did their job and won 8-0 against Houston. The Atlanta Braves needed to lose and in the bottom of the 13th, the Atlanta Braves did just that. All the Cardinals players were watching the t.v in the clubhouse jumping up and down, hugging and crying after realizing they made it to the playoffs.</p>

            <p>Once in the postseason, we defeated the Philidephia Phillies in a thrilling 5 game series that introduced the Rally Squirrel. The next we defeated the Milwaukee Brewers and David Freese was the well deserved MVP of the series. Now in the World Series, the Texas Rangers only stand in our way of becoming Champions of Baseball.</p>
            <p>Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, the greatest game of baseball to have ever been played, if your a Cardinals fan. A back and forth battle all night came down to the bottom of the night, 2 on and 2out, 2strikes. 1 more stike its over and 1 swing could win it. David Freese ends up hitting a triple to tie the game and send it into extra innings. The top of the 10th Josh Hamiliton hit a two-run homerun and all hope seemed lost. In the bottom of the 10th, 2 on, 2out, 2 strikes, down 8-9, the pitch and swing its a basehit into centerfield! Tie game 9-9. A scorless top of the 11th lead to the bottom of the night, first man up is previous hero David Freese. David works the count to 3-2 and then the call "Freese, hits it in the air to center. We will see you, tomorrow night!"</p>
            <p>Chris Carpenter takes the ball in game 7 and before you know it Jason Motte is pitching in the 9th and Allen Craig records the final out. The 2011 St.Louis Cardinals have won the World Series! </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>These past two years we didnt make the playoffs after winning 105 games in 2015 then getting knocked out by the Chicago Cubs.</li>
                    <li>Ryan Franklin blew a 6 run lead in the bottom of the 9th to Colorado.</li>
                    <li>Kolten Wong getting picked off at first for the last out in a World Series game.</li>
                    <li>Matt Holliday dropped a ball in the top of the 9th against LA dodgers and went on to lose the game and series.</li>

            <div id="Frustrating_Cards"><h2>Some of the Blues Greatest Moments I Have Seen</h2>
            <p>As much as I love the blues, I had to have <a href="https://www.nhl.com/blues/team/great-moments">nhl.com</a> assist me in remembering some of the details of these games. The first two bullet points are from the website, but even a detailed description of those great nights wont do it justice. I am a nervous wreck, I pace back and forth, I cry, I yell, I scream and in the end im exhausted from the roller coaster of emotions.</p>
                <div class="First_List">
                    <ul>
                        <li>April 25, 2016 - The Blues are locked in a 2-2 tie with the defending Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks in Game 7 of the Western Conference quarterfinal. With 12:29 left in the period, Blues forward Troy Brouwer banged home a loose puck in the crease, sending the Blues to a big victory over their biggest rivals. The Blues would eventually reach the Western Conference Final for the first time in 15 years.</li>
                        <li>November 29, 2000 - The Blues came back from a 5-0 deficit in the third period to beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 in overtime. It was only the second time a team has come back such a large deficit in the third period to win a game. The Blues scored their six goals in 15 minutes and 27 seconds, making it the fastest time a team has come back from a five-goal deficit in NHL history.</li>
                        <li>Tarasenko scored one of the greatest goals of all time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyRGH7HDs7s">Tarasenko's Great Goal</a></li>

                <figcaption>David Backes gets knocked out cold with this hit from Brent Seabrook</figcaption>
                <ul>
                    <li>I think the worst part of Blues is how many years they have made the playoffs but have never won the Stanley Cup. They made it to the Stanley Cup the first 3 years the franchise existed but didnt win a single game and havent been back since.</li>
                    <li>This 2017-2018 started out great, but a rough 2 months of sub .500 hockey dropped them out of a playoff spot. At 1 point in time they lost 7 in a row and looked lifeless</li>
                    <li>In 1996 we had Wayne Gretzky on our team, and looked primed and ready to win the Stanley Cup. However game 7 of the Divisional Round, Steve Yzerman takes a slap shot from the point and a picture perfect shot beat the Blues goaltender and the Blues lose 0-1 to our rival Detroit Red Wings.</li>
