        <h2>Some of the Blues greatest moments I have seen</h2>
        <div><p>As much as I love the blues, I had to have <a href="www.nhl.com/blues/team/great-moments">Nhl.com</a> assist me in remembering what exactly happend in detail. The first two bullet points are from the website, but even a detailed description of those great nights wont do it justice. I am a nervous wreck, I pace back and forth, I cry, I yell, I scream and in the end im exhausted from the roller coaster of emotions after the game.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>April 25, 2016 - The Blues are locked in a 2-2 tie with the defending Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks in Game 7 of the Western Conference quarterfinal. With 12:29 left in the period, Blues forward Troy Brouwer banged home a loose puck in the crease, sending the Blues to a big victory over their biggest rivals. The Blues would eventually reach the Western Conference Final for the first time in 15 years.</p></li>
            <li><p>November 29, 2000 - The Blues came back from a 5-0 deficit in the third period to beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 in overtime. It was only the second time a team has come back such a large deficit in the third period to win a game. The Blues scored their six goals in 15 minutes and 27 seconds, making it the fastest time a team has come back from a five-goal deficit in NHL history.</p></li>
            <li><p>One playoff year, Barret Jackman and Alex Steen scored game winning overtime goals in game 1 and 2 and then we lost the next 4. Then the next, if I remember right, Barret Jackman and Alex Steen score game winning goals in game 1 and 2. Then went on again to lose the next 4. The result in the end wasnt exactly what you hoped but it was cool to experience those overtime game winning goals in the playoffs.</p></li>
